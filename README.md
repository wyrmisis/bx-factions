# BX-Friendly Journal Templates for Foundry VTT

This module adds a few types of Journal Page to the Foundry virtual tabletop.

## Usage
The Faction sheet is useful for putting together information on factions in your games. It was built with Basic/Expert-compatible TTRPGs in mind, but there's nothing stopping you from using it with other systems! In fact, there's a setting to disable the fame/infamy tracker, if you'd prefer to use these templates solely to document factions in your games.

The Room Key sheet can be used to write out what is in a room in a dungeon, including inhabitants, treasure, traps, and secrets.

### System-specific templates

Additionally, this module includes a template specific to the [Old School Essentials](https://github.com/vttred/ose) system that provides a journal page template for character classes, including XP tables, class resources (like spell slots or thief skills), and spell lists.

## Compatibility
This module was built with features only available starting in Foundry v11. With the exception of the Character Class template, all features are usable with any system, as they does not read system data to function.
